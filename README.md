# Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Big Transfer (BiT) and Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)

This repository contains a project leveraging Big Transfer (BiT) with Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to detect Alzheimer's Disease in medical imaging data. The primary goal of this project is to use the BiT model for efficient feature extraction and an attention-based MIL approach to focus on critical patterns associated with Alzheimer's Disease.

## Overview

Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder, and early detection through medical imaging can play a significant role in patient care. This project combines:
- **Big Transfer (BiT)**: A high-performance transfer learning model that uses pre-trained weights from large datasets, providing effective feature extraction for medical images.
- **Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)**: An attention mechanism that highlights relevant regions within the images, improving model accuracy by focusing on disease-specific patterns.

This approach aims to improve prediction accuracy in Alzheimer's Disease detection through attention-driven instance weighting and the powerful feature extraction of BiT.

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data**:
   - Ensure your medical imaging data is organized in a compatible format (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg` files).
   - Run the preprocessing script provided in `data_preprocessing.py` to structure the data for training.

2. **Train the model**:
   - Use the Jupyter Notebook `BigTransfer_(BiT)_Method_&_Attention_Based_Deep_Multiple_Instance_Learning_(MIL)_For_Alzheimer_Disease_Detection.ipynb` to run experiments, training the model on your dataset.
   - Modify hyperparameters as needed to fine-tune performance.

3. **Evaluate and Visualize Results**:
   - Results from training, including attention maps, can be visualized directly in the notebook.

## Project Structure

- `BigTransfer_(BiT)_Method_&_Attention_Based_Deep_Multiple_Instance_Learning_(MIL)_For_Alzheimer_Disease_Detection.ipynb`: Main notebook implementing the BiT and MIL model for Alzheimerâ€™s detection.
- `data/`: Folder to place the medical imaging dataset.
- `models/`: Contains model definitions for BiT and MIL.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, visualization, and metric calculation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Results

The model generates various metrics to evaluate performance, including:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

Additionally, attention maps created by the MIL layer are visualized to highlight regions most indicative of Alzheimer's Disease, aiding in model interpretability.
